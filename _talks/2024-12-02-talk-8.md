Optimal Control, LQR, A* Search, Robotics

Project Member

•	Designed a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for high-speed trajectory tracking with robust control performance.

•	Integrated an A* search algorithm for dynamic path re-planning to perform safe overtaking maneuvers in complex traffic scenarios.

•	Achieved an average path tracking error of 0.76m, demonstrating precise control and navigation capabilities.

•	Implemented real-time obstacle avoidance and replanning strategies for autonomous vehicle navigation.
