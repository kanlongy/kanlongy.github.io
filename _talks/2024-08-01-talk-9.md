Project Member

•	Implemented a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) from scratch for high-quality image generation.

•	Applied the model to the AFHQ (Animal Faces-HQ) dataset, demonstrating strong generative capabilities across diverse animal categories.

•	Conducted extensive experiments with noise scheduling strategies and U-Net architecture optimization.

•	Achieved competitive FID scores, validating the effectiveness of the implementation for realistic image synthesis.
