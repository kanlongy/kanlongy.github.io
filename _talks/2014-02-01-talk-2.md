Research Assistant | Supervisor: Prof. Shuji Tanaka & Assist. Prof. Andrea Vergara

•	Acquired a comprehensive understanding of the principles associated with MEMS processing and have gained hands-on experience in the complete process, encompassing deposition, photolithography, etching, dicing, wire bonding, and packaging.

•	Designed an effective angle sensor structure for the slow axis of a 2D piezoelectric micromirror utilizing Si piezoresistors, resulting in enhanced feedback control sensitivity.

•	Manufactured prototype testing devices (including cantilever and meandering structures) on a Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafer equipped with integrated Si piezoresistors by employing doped wiring techniques.

•	Conducted output characterization and performed a comparative analysis with simulation and calculation results.
