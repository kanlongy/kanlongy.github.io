## Introduction

MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) micromirrors are critical components in optical applications such as laser scanning displays, LiDAR systems, and biomedical imaging. Two-dimensional (2D) piezoelectric micromirrors require precise angle control on both axes, but the slow axis often lacks effective feedback sensing due to mechanical design constraints.

**Project Objective:** Design and fabricate an integrated Si piezoresistive angle sensor for the slow axis of a 2D piezoelectric micromirror to enable closed-loop feedback control and improve positioning accuracy.

**Impact:** This research contributes to the development of high-precision optical MEMS devices with applications in autonomous vehicles (LiDAR), medical imaging (endoscopy), and augmented reality displays.

## Methods

### Sensor Design

I designed a piezoresistive angle sensor structure specifically for the slow axis of the 2D piezoelectric micromirror:

**Design Approach:**
- Integrated Si piezoresistors at the hinge locations where mechanical stress is maximized during mirror rotation
- Optimized sensor geometry to balance sensitivity and mechanical robustness
- Designed two prototype structures: cantilever and meandering configurations for comparative analysis

**Finite Element Analysis (FEA):**
- Performed stress distribution analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics
- Simulated piezoresistive output under various deflection angles
- Validated sensor placement and geometry optimization

5. **Dicing**: Wafer separation into individual device chips
6. **Wire Bonding**: Electrical connection to package pins
7. **Packaging**: Device encapsulation and protection

**Fabrication Techniques:**
- Doped wiring technique for creating low-resistance interconnects
