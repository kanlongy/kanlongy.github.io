Graduation Thesis | Supervisor: Assoc. Prof. Ran Zhang

•	Focused on the study of bio-inspired polarized light navigation using polarization angle images in an underwater Snell window for solar meridian acquisition.

•	Designed a solar meridian extraction method based on the principle of Hough Transform and implemented an algorithm in C++ to automatically extract the solar meridian from the image.

•	Applied my algorithm to find the solar azimuth angle, and the accuracy is verified to be within 1.5 degrees through outdoor experiments.

•	Completed and defended the graduation thesis with distinction.
