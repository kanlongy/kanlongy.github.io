Experience
======

**Research Assistant** | CERLAB, Carnegie Mellon University  
*Aug. 2024 – Present | Pittsburgh, USA*  
*Supervisor: Kenji Shimada*

* Implemented LSTM-PPO architecture for wind-resilient UAV RL-control, modeling various wind fields in Gazebo/Isaac Sim and training distributed wind-aware policies that improved UAV navigation robustness.
* Contributed to the development of the popular open project CERLAB UAV Autonomy stack in ROS, Gazebo, and Isaac Sim. Integrated point cloud reconstruction after dynamic obstacle removal.
* Built a custom LiDAR-based UAV platform and conducted real tunnel inspection tests for Toprise Inc Japan., achieving high-resolution 3D reconstruction (accuracy < 5cm).

**Software Engineer Intern** | Perflection AI  
*May. 2025 – Aug. 2025 | Pittsburgh, USA*

* Benchmarked state-of-the-art vision-language models (Qwen2.5-VL, Tarsier, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro) for golf advice accuracy and curated domain-specific datasets for fine-tuning.
* Designed and iteratively refined prompt engineering strategies, transforming generic outputs into personalized and actionable coaching feedback.
* Incorporated key frame analysis and biomechanical metrics into the feedback pipeline, improving swing issue detection and user trust in model-generated advice.
