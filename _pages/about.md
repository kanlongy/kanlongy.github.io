Hi there!  你好呀!  こんにちは!

I'm **Kanlong Ye**, a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics Track) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), specializing in **Robotics and AI**. With a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, I am passionate about advancing intelligent robotic systems that can navigate and understand the physical world.

## Research & Interests

At CMU, my research lies at the **intersection of machine learning and robotics**. I work in the [Computational Engineering & Robotics Lab (CERLAB)](https://zhefanxu.com/uav_team/) under Professor [Kenji Shimada](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/shimada-kenji.html), where I focus on:

- **LiDAR-based UAV inspection** in complex indoor environments (tunnels, bridges)
- **Wind-aware autonomous control** using reinforcement learning (Transformer-PPO)
- **Real-world SLAM and trajectory planning** on diverse robotic platforms

I've built **full UAV autonomy stacks from the ground up**—both in simulation (Gazebo, Isaac Sim) and on physical platforms—integrating perception, planning, and control for robust autonomous navigation.

## Recent Highlights

**December 2024:** Successfully completed autonomous tunnel inspection demonstration for **TOPRISE CO., LTD** in Fukushima, Japan. Our team deployed a custom LiDAR-equipped UAV system for real-world infrastructure inspection, achieving high-resolution 3D reconstruction (accuracy < 5cm).

## Background & Experience

I received my B.Eng in Mechanical Design & Manufacturing and Their Automation (Japanese Intensive) from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2024, where I gained extensive hands-on experience in robotics:

- Programming robotic arms for manipulation tasks
- Designing and fabricating mechanical systems and MEMS devices
- Developing computer vision algorithms for underwater robot navigation
- MEMS research at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/) (2023)

## Technical Skills & Languages

I thrive in **interdisciplinary environments where AI meets physical systems**. 

**Technical:** Python, C++, ROS/ROS2, PyTorch, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, MATLAB, Git  
**Languages:** Chinese (Native), English (Fluent), Japanese (Fluent)

I bring both technical versatility and a global perspective to collaborative robotics projects.

## Looking Forward

I'm currently seeking **research or industry opportunities** in robotics, autonomous systems, and machine learning. Let's connect if you're working on building smarter, more capable robots—or simply share an interest in drones, machine learning, or reinforcement learning!
