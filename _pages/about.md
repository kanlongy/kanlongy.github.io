Hi there!  你好呀!  こんにちは!

My name is Kanlong Ye. Currently, I am a master’s student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I received my B.Eng degree in Mechanical Design & Manufacturing and Their Automation (Japanese Intensive) from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2024. I went on an exchange program to the Mechanical Department at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/) in 2023. 

I am interested in a variety of topics related to Robotics! Such as SLAM, motion planning, reinforcement learning, etc. Also very keen on applying these robotics technologies to mobile robots or robotic arms.

Check out my CV [here](../assets/cv.pdf).

Anouncement
======
Right now, I am actively looking to join a Lab.The MSME-Research program requires me to do four semesters of research, so I will be graduating in May 2026! Since I hope to pursue a PhD after graduation, I will be doing a research internship in the summer of 2025, so I will have plenty of time to get involved in research!

I have had extensive robotics experience, such as programming and operating robotic arms to grasp objects and write; designing and machining mechanical structures; and utilizing computer vision to aid in underwater robot navigation. Also, I have strong programming and math skills, and am curious about research around robotics using machine learning, reinforcement learning, and more!
