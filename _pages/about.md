Hello! 你好! こんにちは!

My name is Kanlong Ye. Currently, I am a master’s student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I received my B.Eng degree in Mechanical Design & Manufacturing and Their Automation (Japanese Intensive) from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2024. I went on an exchange program to the Mechanical Department at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/) in 2023. 

I am interested in a variety of topics related to Robotics! Such as controls and dynamics, design and simulation, motion planning, SLAM, Artificial Intelligence and optimization. Also very keen on applying these robotics technologies to legged robots, micro-robots, robotic arms or bionic robots.

Check out my CV [here](../assets/cv.pdf).
